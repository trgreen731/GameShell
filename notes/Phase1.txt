 - show a shape on the screen and move the shape with key inputs
 - establish a windows compilation method
 - establish a linux compilation method
 - created ability to display and track multiple shapes
 - created the host and join classes that will use UDP
 - tested winsock method of socket programming with simple sender and receiver
 - built the host initialization function
 - built the packet handler of the host
 - built the display message builder for the host
 - built the join request handshake function
 - built the join send and recv threads and corresponding helper functions
 - built the join and host quit functions
 - small read through fixes and extra error checking
 - rework the host quit function to be a bit more elegant
 - Slight adjustments to the mutex locking and unlocking to avoid deadlock
 - Rework the join quit function to not recv in parallel with join receive (added exit check timer so doesnt hold exit lock so often)
 - Function descriptions for connect classes
 - Added maximum framerate timers for sending updates of player locations
 - Fixed main function to work with the new join and host classes
 - Added send pause to avoid sending in key or disp updates and requests at same time
 - Syntax error correction
 - Disconnected host and join send and recv threads as cannot be part of a class
 - Adjusted makefile with connectstruct file to successfully run the program
 - Status out created to print important steps
 - get_timestamp fixed to output the time since last hour since unaffected by time zones
 - Fixed several errors shown in buglog to get proper players working (one host, one join on single device)
 - Adjusted steps and process of host and join quit so that quitting on host or join end when 1 host and 1 join on same device functions properly
 - Added threading to the recv of the host and join so packets handled while more packets can be received. Backlog limit to prevent excessive packet input preventing normal processor operation.
 - Ran test with host and join on own device -> succeeded
 - Ran test with host and join on alternate device -> pogram begins but the connection to host is not made
 + Added error logging and message logging files and capabilities
