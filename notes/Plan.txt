Phase 1:
 - Add latency measure, packet loss detection, send rate, recv rate, etc all to be written to log file
 - Rework some of the info structures and storage locations
	-> move the conn_info into the classes if possible
	-> possibly create a parent class and make the join and host child classes
 - Run base test between separate devices on same local network (local host comms)
 - Provide color info for the player when joining (either in request or response)
 - set up a basic encryption method -> AES (or other symmetric key) encryption and decryption with a given key

Phase 2:
 - get the old mac disk version from katie to the vm
 - Rework the program to run on mac os (defined precompiler constants)
 - be conscious of the little vs big endian for packet info
 - test on local device within vm then if succeeds, test with katie's computer and my computer for cross platform

Phase 3:
 - Research some more about port forwarding to see if it is a viable option to avoid need for AWS
 - Set up AWS server to allow for use outside of local networks
	-> server should have whitelisted ip addresses that will be added manually
	-> server should only hold currently available addresses and games for limited time
	-> whitelisting an address will come with a provided symmetric key (AES) used to communicate with server, this server then also can serve as the KDC for p2p communication encryption
 - Build necessary components to allow for server communication with encryption methods (test using local pseudo server)

Phase 4:
 - Basic player model and sprite creation (break into the 418 content)
 - look into creating a defined structure for a custom file to hold image data (or just use images who cares)
 - Start adding adjustable settings
 - Create a menu screen and game state
 - Create selectable single and multiplayer

Long Term Game Ideas
 - Create a fighting style game (similar to smash or arcade style)
 - Start with black panther character model and expand
 - Implement single or multiplayer choices with socket programming for multiplayer
 - Implement basic enemy for single player mode (AI based??)
 - Make sure have adjustable settings
